# Okay so...
Well you see, generally, im not an active person. Pfftt you probably know that ( i wouldnt have a github account ). But since the onset of this whole pandemic situation my "activeness" went psycho mode and i started to go out more and socialize more, better yet, run 121km in 30 days. I trusted my immunity system. and i really thought " I am going out so much i mustve gotten the virus and it would have passed". Guess what? that wasnt the case! So guess who got the virus. That's right, me.
Now when you get the virus, your parents freak out your neighbours freak out your relatives who haven't seen you since you hit your puberty freak out.
And for the love of god, they wouldn't stop asking me how i was.
So, putting on my coder hodddie i made this. 
react app, and fauna db and yadayadayada
I am fine guys.
